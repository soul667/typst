    比赛简介: RoboMaster is a global robotics competition initiated by DJI Innovations. Teams are required to design, build, and operate various types of robots to complete tasks. Compared to competitions like the National Electronics Design Contest and Mathematical Contest in Modeling, RoboMaster has a longer competition cycle, usually lasting a whole year, and requires higher energy investment from participants. Unlike the traditional three-person team model, RoboMaster teams are large, usually consisting of 30 to 40 members, working together to tackle technical challenges. This competition cultivates perseverance and teamwork skills that are difficult to acquire in other contests. Participants not only improve their technical skills but also develop strong perseverance and outstanding teamwork abilities.
