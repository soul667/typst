# Theme gallery

If you decide to use one of the themes shipped with polylux, you can use this
gallery to get to know how each theme works and if you like how it looks.
All themes follow the convention introduced on the previous page if not stated
otherwise.
For many things, most themes are interchangable, meaning that you can simply
change what theme you import and its initialisation and everything still works.
However, this is not guaranteed and might break at any point.
